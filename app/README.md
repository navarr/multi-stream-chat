## Gifts

A gift is like a tip. It is something given to the streamer during the live stream.

[1]: Twitch supports something called "Gigantify Emote" as a message effect. This is similar to a single sticker, which
is what Discord supports. However, Twitch lets you send a message along with the gigantic emote.  
[2]: Discord stream chat is within the video chat room, and is treated like a thread already - however you can reply to other comments
